# Password Security Evaluation

This repository documents an activity on evaluating password strength, understanding best practices, and analyzing password security.

---

## 📌 Task Objectives

1. Create multiple passwords with varying complexity.
2. Use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and length variations.
3. Test each password on an online password strength checker.
4. Record scores and feedback from the tool.
5. Identify best practices for creating strong passwords.
6. Write down tips learned from the evaluation.
7. Research common password attacks (e.g., brute force, dictionary).
8. Summarize how password complexity affects security.

## 🔑 Password Testing

| Password            | Strength Feedback                      | Score/Rating |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `apple123`          | Very weak, easily guessed in seconds   | Weak         |
| `Summer2025`        | Weak, guessable in minutes             | Weak         |
| `P@ssw0rd!`         | Moderate, still common pattern         | Medium       |
| `T!mE2$ecure#2025`  | Strong, resistant to brute-force       | Strong       |
| `M0n^Light!_7Star$` | Very strong, long + diverse characters | Very Strong  |

## ✅ Best Practices Learned

* Use **12+ characters**.
* Mix **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.
* Avoid dictionary words and predictable substitutions.
* Do not reuse passwords across accounts.
* Use **passphrases** or a **password manager** for strong, unique credentials.

## 🛡️ Common Password Attacks

* **Brute Force**: Tries all combinations; longer passwords resist better.
* **Dictionary Attack**: Uses common words/password lists; avoid dictionary words.
* **Credential Stuffing**: Reuses leaked credentials; don’t reuse passwords.
* **Phishing/Social Engineering**: Tricks users into revealing passwords.

## 📖 Conclusion

Password complexity significantly improves security.

* **Weak passwords** are easily cracked within seconds or minutes.
* **Strong passwords** with length, randomness, and diverse characters can withstand brute force attempts for years.
* Following best practices reduces vulnerability to automated and manual attacks.
